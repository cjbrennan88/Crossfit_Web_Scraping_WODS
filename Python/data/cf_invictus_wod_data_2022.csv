“Rabbit’s Delight”
Objective:
Complete as many repetitions as you can, as quickly as you can.
Mission:
Teams of two must complete as many repetitions of the following movements as they can in the time it takes their partner to sprint 400 meters. The mission will commence with one partner running and the other on one of the assigned movements. The “indoor” partner will complete as many repetitions of the movement as they can until their partner returns and they switch roles. After both partners have completed a run and the first movement, the cycle repeats until each partner has completed four 400 meter sprints and completed all four of the movements.
Movements:
Thrusters (45/33 lb)
Kettlebell Swings (24/16 kg)
Wall Ball Shots (20/14 lb)
Box Jumps (24″/20″)
Scoring:
A team’s score will be determined by the number of repetitions they complete of the indoor movements, adjusted by time penalties. One point will be subtracted from the team’s score for every 2 seconds that team finishes behind the first team to finish.
(E.g., If the first team to finish completes 320 repetitions in 15:00 minutes, their total score is 320. A team that completes 350 repetitions in 16:00 minutes will also have a total score of 320 after they have been assessed their penalties.)

“Remember Carter”
Carter Robert Couch was born on November 14, 2019. From the moment he was born to the day he went to heaven, he brought nothing but love, smiles and laughter to the world. Carter was a ball of energy that loved every aspect of life. He was caring, empathetic and the sweetest boy with a unique way of connecting emotionally with every person he came across. As the son of a baseball strength coach, he loved coming to the stadium to hit, throw and “workout” at daddy’s office. Hours upon hours were spent watching, playing and sharing smiles at the baseball stadium. Whether he was hitting homers, playing cars, reading or dancing, he did everything with a smile on his face. His laugh was contagious, and it would immediately brighten your day. He was deeply loved and showed his love by giving high fives, knucks and big bear hugs.
Carter started experiencing seizures he was 1.5. He was diagnosed with epilepsy and bravely fought off episodes over the past year. He went home to heaven on June 28 from complications with epilepsy. While we miss our little boy terribly, and the grief is beyond measure, we have hope and faith that we will see our smiling little boy again in heaven. We are humbled to honor Carter’s life and legacy with y’all as part of the November community workout. We simply ask that you think about our Carter throughout the workout and smile as big as you can while “running the bases” because that’s how Carter would do it. For those of you who are able, we’re asking that you consider a small donation to Carter’s epilepsy foundation page.
https://donate.epilepsy.com/
index.cfm?fuseaction=
donorDrive.personalCampaign&
participantID=55317
Their mission is to lead the fight in overcoming the challenges of living with epilepsy and to accelerate therapies to stop seizures. We hope that one day we will help find a cure so that no family has to endure what we are going through. I challenge you all to #CtheGood in the life that you have—life is too short not to. Carter saw the good in every day and in everyone. He found the good because he looked for it. Y’all should do the same!

Objective:
Complete as many repetitions as you can, as quickly as you can.
Mission:
Teams of two must complete as many repetitions of the following movements as they can in the time it takes their partner to sprint 400 meters. The mission will commence with one partner running and the other on one of the assigned movements. The “indoor” partner will complete as many repetitions of the movement as they can until their partner returns and they switch roles. After both partners have completed a run and the first movement, the cycle repeats until each partner has completed four 400 meter sprints and completed all four of the movements.
Movements:
Thrusters (45/33 lb)
Kettlebell Swings (24/16 kg)
Wall Ball Shots (20/14 lb)
Box Jumps (24″/20″)
Scoring:
A team’s score will be determined by the number of repetitions they complete of the indoor movements, adjusted by time penalties. One point will be subtracted from the team’s score for every 2 seconds that team finishes behind the first team to finish.
(E.g., If the first team to finish completes 320 repetitions in 15:00 minutes, their total score is 320. A team that completes 350 repetitions in 16:00 minutes will also have a total score of 320 after they have been assessed their penalties.)",
